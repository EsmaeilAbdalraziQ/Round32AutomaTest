AutomaTest: Test Automation Training Practice Project in Round32

🚀 Automation Testing Training Practice

📘 About This Project

This repository is created as part of my Automation Testing Training Practice. 
Each session includes a set of tasks that I implemented to strengthen my hands-on skills. 
For better clarity and learning, I have added detailed documentation above each Test Class and Test Function to explain the purpose, logic, and flow of the written code.
The project also focuses on practicing different element locators (ID, Name, CSS Selectors, XPath, etc.) to build a strong foundation in Selenium automation. 
The goal is to create a clear, step-by-step reference for my own practice and for anyone who wants to follow along.
